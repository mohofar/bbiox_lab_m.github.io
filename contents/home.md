# BBIOX Lab: Biomechanics and Biomaterials Research

Welcome to the BBIOX Lab's repository! Our lab, led by Dr. Nazlı Tümer, is dedicated to advancing research in the biomechanics of bones and biomaterials. We employ both computational and experimental approaches to study the mechanical behavior of biological tissues and develop advanced biomaterials for medical applications.
